# Kubernetes Observability and Pod Design



## Pods
### Pod Structure and Usage
- **Definition:** Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. They represent a single instance of a running process in a cluster.
- **Components of a Pod:**
  - **Containers:** Typically one container per pod, but can include multiple containers for closely related processes. Containers within a pod share the same:
    - **Network Namespace:** Containers can communicate using `localhost`.
    - **Storage:** Shared volumes that persist data.
  - **Init Containers:** Special containers that run before the main application container starts. Useful for initialization tasks.

- **Networking:**
  - Each pod gets its own IP address, enabling communication between containers inside and outside the pod.

- **Usage:**
  - Ideal for running closely coupled processes.
  - Commonly used for applications like microservices, batch jobs, and single-instance databases.

### Significance of Label Selectors and Annotations in Pods
#### Labels
- **Definition:** Key-value pairs assigned to Kubernetes objects.
- **Purpose:** Used to categorize and organize resources efficiently.
- **Examples:**
  ```yaml
  labels:
    app: frontend
    env: prod
  ```
- **Benefits:**
  - Simplifies grouping of objects for queries and operations.
  - Enables targeted updates and deployments.

#### Selectors
- **Definition:** Filters that group objects based on their labels.
- **Types:**
  - **Equality-Based Selectors:** Match objects with specific key-value pairs.
  - **Set-Based Selectors:** Match objects based on a set of criteria.

- **Examples:**
  ```yaml
  matchLabels:
    app: frontend
    env: prod
  ```

#### Annotations
- **Definition:** Non-identifying metadata for Kubernetes objects.
- **Purpose:** Provides additional information, often used by external tools and systems.
- **Examples:**
  ```yaml
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
    description: "This pod runs the frontend service."
  ```
- **Common Use Cases:**
  - Monitoring (e.g., Prometheus scraping configurations).
  - Documentation.

## Probes
### Introduction
Probes are used to determine the health and operational status of containers. Kubernetes uses probes to decide whether a container is ready to accept traffic or needs to be restarted.

### Types of Probes
#### 1. Startup Probe
- **Purpose:** Ensures containers with long initialization times are not prematurely marked as failed.
- **When to Use:** Applications that perform significant setup tasks before becoming operational.
- **Behavior:** Delays the execution of readiness and liveness probes.
- **Example:**
  ```yaml
  startupProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /healthz
      port: 8080
    failureThreshold: 30
    periodSeconds: 10
  ```

#### 2. Readiness Probe
- **Purpose:** Determines if a container is ready to accept traffic.
- **Behavior:** Traffic is routed only to pods that pass the readiness probe.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Applications that load configuration files or establish database connections before serving traffic.
- **Example:**
  ```yaml
  readinessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /ready
      port: 8080
    initialDelaySeconds: 5
    periodSeconds: 10
  ```

#### 3. Liveness Probe
- **Purpose:** Ensures a container is functioning as expected. If a container fails this probe, it is restarted.
- **Behavior:** Used to recover from application crashes or deadlocks.
- **Example:**
  ```yaml
  livenessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /healthz
      port: 8080
    initialDelaySeconds: 3
    periodSeconds: 5
  ```

## Label Selectors and Annotations
### Labels
- **Primary Use:** Categorization and identification of objects.
- **Advanced Example:**
  ```yaml
  metadata:
    labels:
      app: ecommerce
      tier: backend
      release: stable
  ```

### Selectors
- **Advanced Usage:**
  ```yaml
  matchExpressions:
    - key: tier
      operator: In
      values:
      - frontend
      - backend
  ```
- **Purpose:** Enables complex filtering logic for grouping resources.

### Annotations
- **Use in Observability:** Helps integrate tools like Prometheus or Grafana.
- **Example with Multiple Annotations:**
  ```yaml
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
    prometheus.io/path: "/metrics"
    team: "devops"
  ```

## Matrics Server
  # Installing Kubernetes Metrics Server

To install the Kubernetes Metrics Server, use the following command to download the latest `components.yaml` file:

```sh
wget https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
```

## Explanation
- `wget` → Command-line tool to download files from the web.
- `https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml` → The URL for downloading the latest version of `components.yaml`.

## Next Steps

1. **Apply the manifest** to deploy Metrics Server in your cluster:
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f components.yaml
   ```

2. **Verify deployment:**
   ```sh
   kubectl get deployment metrics-server -n kube-system
   ```

3. **Test metrics collection:**
   ```sh
   kubectl top nodes
   kubectl top pods
   ```

If you encounter TLS issues, you may need to enable insecure TLS by modifying the deployment arguments. You can do this by adding the following flag to the Metrics Server deployment:

```sh
kubectl patch deployment metrics-server -n kube-system --type='json' -p='[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-", "value": "--kubelet-insecure-tls"}]'
```


## Deployment Strategies
### Update Strategies
- **Maximum Unavailable:**
  - Limits the number of unavailable pods during updates.
  - Ensures a minimum number of pods remain operational.
- **Maximum Surge:**
  - Defines how many additional pods can be temporarily created during updates.
  - Allows updates without reducing available capacity.

### Deployment Types
#### Blue-Green Deployment
- **Workflow:**
  1. Deploy Blue (current version).
  2. Deploy Green (new version) alongside Blue.
  3. Switch traffic to Green after successful testing.
- **Benefits:**
  - Zero downtime.
  - Immediate rollback capability.
- **Challenges:**
  - Requires additional resources for parallel deployments.

#### Canary Deployment
- **Workflow:**
  1. Incrementally roll out changes to a small subset of users.
  2. Monitor the impact and error rate.
  3. Gradually scale Canary or revert to Base if needed.
- **Benefits:**
  - Fine-grained control over deployment.
  - Early detection of issues.

## Practical Demonstrations of Deployment Strategies
### Key Steps for Deployment
1. **Create Base Deployment:** Defines the stable version of the application.
2. **Create Canary Deployment:** Defines the new version of the application with reduced initial traffic.
3. **Configure Services:** Use labels and selectors to route traffic appropriately.
4. **Monitor Performance:**
   - Check logs for errors.
   - Validate system performance.
5. **Handle Failures:** Scale back Canary to zero if errors occur.
6. **Finalize Rollout:** Scale Canary incrementally and balance traffic distribution.

### Example Configuration
#### Base Deployment
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
